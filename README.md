I am pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Villanova University. The use of IoT in everyday objects like smartphones, smart homes, smart cars, etc. has become ubiquitous. Although I have no prior experience in managing hardware devices, the combination of hardware, data analytics, and cloud computing sounds interesting. What caught my attention is the fact that which Professor mentioned in the first class, that there are more devices connected to the internet than the number of people. My purpose of taking this course is to learn about this emerging technology by having some practical hands-on.
The IoT application domain that interests me is IoT-based environmental monitoring. Most industries are dependent on detecting emissions of poisonous gases, chemical spills, harmful pollutants, plant temperature, etc. These are critical for not only the safety of workers but also the efficient operation of factory machinery. In the past, this type of monitoring was accomplished manually but IoT devices have enabled remote and consistent sensor data collection. Some interesting use cases/examples of IoT environment monitoring are:
1.	Municipal water treatment monitoring
2.	Agricultural irrigation monitoring and control
3.	Ambient air quality monitoring for pollutants, lead and toxic particulates <br/>

With these applications, industries or governments make sure that the air or water that reaches us is of high quality and toxin-free. The data gathered from auto emissions help the automobile industries to continuously improve designs to reduce emissions.
Also, another interesting application of IOT which I found is in natural disaster management. A quick response can be achieved in many scenarios like forest fire detection, earthquake detection, etc. This can help governments in timely evacuation and damage control procedures.
I am interested in exploring the OpenRemote IOT platform as I am looking for an open-source platform where I can gain some experience before moving on to paid services. OpenRemote provides a dashboard to control and monitor applications which seems appealing to me.
